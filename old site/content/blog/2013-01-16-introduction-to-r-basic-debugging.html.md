In this post we will talk about native debugging support in R. Mostly,
you start debugging when something goes wrong, which have many
indications:

-   **message** A generic notification/diagnostic message produced by
    the message function; execution of the function continues.
-   **warning** An indication that something is wrong but not
    necessarily fatal; execution of the function continues; generated by
    the warning function; you got it after the function completion.
-   **error** An indication that a fatal problem has occurred; execution
    stops; produced by the stop function.
-   **condition** A generic concept for indicating that something
    unexpected can occur; programmers can create their own conditions.

The primary tools for debugging functions in R are:

**traceback()** prints out the function call stack after an error
occurs; does nothing if there’s no error.

**debug(f)** flags a function for “debug” mode by setting a breakpoint
at the beginning of the function f which allows you to step through
execution of a function one line at a time. Use undebug() to turn off
debug mode for that function. The debug mode turned off automatically
when reloading your code using source().

When you execute your code and hit a breakpoint, you enter the debugger
which called the browser in R. The command prompt will be something like
Browse\[2\] instead of just &gt;.

Then you can invoke various debugging operations operations:

-   **n** or **Enter** to step through single line of code. If it is a
    line-level breakpoint, you have to hit n the first time, then Enter
    after that.
-   **c** to skip to the end of the current context (a loop or a
    function).
-   **where** to get a stack report
-   **Q** to exit the debugger and return to the &gt; command line.
-   All normal R operations and functions are still available to you. So
    for instance to query the value of  
    a variable, just type its name, as you would in ordinary interactive
    usage of R. If the variable’s name  
    is one of the debug() commands, though, say c, you’ll need to do
    something like print(c) to print it  
    out.

**browser()** suspends the execution of a function wherever it is called
and puts the function in debug mode.

**recover** allows you to modify the error behavior so that you can
browse the function call stack. It’s a global option that applies for
the current global environment. You set it by calling options(error =
recover) after that, any functions causes an error to occur you will get
function call stack (like the one you got from traceback) with the
option to jump into debugging any function that call stack.

**trace()** allows you to insert debugging code into a function at
specific places. For example trace(f, t) would instruct R to call the
function t() every time we enter the function f(). This helps if you
want to put a breakpoint in the beginning of a specific function in your
code file without opening the file, modifying the function, reloading
the file using source(). You can just call trace(Your\_Function,
browser) . When you done with debugging this function you can call,
untrace(Your\_Function) to remove that debugging feature from your
function.

These are interactive tools specifically designed to allow you to pick
through a function. There’s also the more blunt technique of inserting
print/cat statements in the function.

Stay tuned for more R notes.
