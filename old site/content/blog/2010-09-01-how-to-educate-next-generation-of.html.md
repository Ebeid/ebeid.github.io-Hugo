After my completion of my master in software engineering at [Nile
University](http://www.nileu.edu.eg/) which we faced many problems at it
(I hope it be better in the future), I tried to search for what globally
constitutes a master of software engineering and I found the following:

-   The last effort to create a reference curriculum for graduate
    software engineering education was by the SEI in the early 1990s.
-   There were, in effect, no current community-endorsed recommendations
    on what to teach software engineers.
-   Response: create a project to create a new reference curriculum in
    software engineering (iSSec Project)

**The Integrated Software and  
Systems Engineering Curriculum iSSec Project**

**iSSec** Project begun in May 2007 at Stevens Institute of Technology
and sponsored by DoD Director of Systems and Software Engineering
Kristen Baldwin. Three products planned for iSSec:

1.  A modern reference curriculum for a master’s degree in software
    engineering that integrates an appropriate amount of systems
    engineering
2.  A modern reference curriculum for a master’s degree in systems
    engineering that integrates an appropriate amount of software
    engineering
3.  A truly interdisciplinary degree that is neither systems nor
    software engineering – it is both

What interests me the most is the first product, and it is the only
completed product. A project of seven steps had been set to produce that
reference curriculum:

1.  Understand the current state of SwE graduate education
    (November 2007)
2.  Create GSwE2009 0.25 (formerly GSwERC) with a small team, suitable
    for limited review (February 2008)
3.  Publicize effort through conferences, papers, website, etc
    (continuous)
4.  Create GSwE2009 0.50 (formerly GSwERC) suitable for broad community
    review and early adoption (October 2008)
5.  Create GSwE2009 1.0 suitable for broad adoption (September 2009)
6.  Transition stewardship to professional societies (Late
    2009-Early 2010)
7.  Foster adoption world-wide (2009 and beyond)

Steps 6 and 7 are undertaking now.

*[Graduate  Software  Engineering  2009  (GSwE2009):  Curriculum 
Guidelines  for  Graduate Degree Programs in Software
Engineering](http://www.gswe2009.org/fileadmin/files/GSwE2009_Curriculum_Docs/GSwE2009_version_1.0.pdf)*
is the first product of the iSSEc project.

This document is a reference for anyone currently in a master program in
software engineering or will enroll in such a program. GSwE2009 is a
REFERENCE curriculum, not an absolute statement of requirements. It is a
set of recommendations to universities on the best guidance that the
authors could generate, incorporating extensive review comments from the
broad community. The authors believe that GSwE2009 sets the “gold
standard” for graduate software engineering education. Here is the
summary of the most important parts of GSwE2009, outcomes and
requirements.

  
**Summary of Outcomes**  
Graduates of a master‘s program that satisfies GSwE2009 recommendations
will:

1.  <span class="underline">CBOK</span> : Master the CBOK (Core Body Of
    Knowledge).
2.  <span class="underline">DOMAIN</span> : Master software engineering
    in at least one application domain, such as  finance, medical,
    transportation, or telecommunications, and one application type,
    such as real-time, embedded, safety-critical, or highly distributed
    systems. That mastery includes understanding how differences in
    domain and type manifest themselves in both the software itself and
    in its engineering, and includes understanding how to learn a new
    application domain or type.
3.  <span class="underline">DEPTH</span> : Master at least one KA
    (Knowledge Area) or sub-area from the CBOK to at least the Bloom
    Synthesis level.
4.  <span class="underline">ETHICS</span> : Be abl e to make ethical
    professional decisions and practice ethical professional behavior.
5.  <span class="underline">SYSTEMS ENGINEERING</span> : Understand the
    relationship  between SwE and SE and  be able to apply SE principles
    and practices in the engineering of software.
6.  <span class="underline">TEAM</span> : Be an effective member of a
    team, including teams that are international and geographically
    distributed, effectively communicate both orally and in writing, and
    lead in one area of project development, such as project management,
    requirements analysis, architecture, construction, or quality
    assurance.
7.  <span class="underline">RECONCILIATION</span> : Be able to reconcile
    conflicting project objectives, finding acceptable compromises
    within  
    limitations of cost, time, knowledge, existing systems, and
    organizations.
8.  <span class="underline">PERSPECTIVE</span> : Understand and
    appreciate feasibility analysis, negotiation, and good
    communications with stakeholders in a typical software development
    environment, and be able to perform those tasks well; have effective
    work habits and be a leader.
9.  <span class="underline">LEARNING</span> : Be able to learn new
    models, techniques, and technologies as they emerge, and
    appreciate  
    the necessity of such continuing professional development.
10. <span class="underline">TECHNOLOGY</span> : Be  able  to  analyze 
    a  current  significant  software  technology,  articulate  its 
    strengths  and weaknesses, compare it to alternative technologies,
    and specify and promote improvements or extensions to that
    technology.  

**Summary of Expected Background  
**GSwE2009 presumes that an entering student has:

1.  <span class="underline">DEGREE</span> : The equivalent of an
    undergraduate degree in computing or an undergraduate degree in an
    engineering or scientific field and a minor in computing,
2.  <span class="underline">SWE COURSE</span> : The equivalent of an
    introductory course in software engineering, and
3.  <span class="underline">EXPERIENCE</span> :At least two years of
    practical experience in some aspect  of software engineering or
    software development.

As Nile University is the only institute in Egypt that give a master
degree in software engineering, I hope they follow this reference
curriculum.

Individuals can also use it to guide their self-study plans in software
engineering.
