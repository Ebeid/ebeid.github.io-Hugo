We talked in a previous
[post](http://ebeid-soliman.blogspot.com/2013/04/why-pex-choose-these-inputs.html "Why Pex Choose These Inputs")
about Microsoft Pex and how it choose values to explore your code
through symbolically executing it and getting all its paths. A code path
is the represented by all the conditions that have to be satisfied in
order to make the code execution go to this path. Your code conditional
statements will lead to different paths according to different input
values. Test cases generated by Pex represents the code behavior for
specific input values that lead to specific code path.

Within the parameterized unit test You can use the method
**GetPathConditionString** of the **PexSymbolicValue** class to obtain a
textual representation of the current path condition, a predicate
(condition) that characterizes an execution path (below, column with
title Condition) .

Methods **ToRawString** and **GetRawPathConditionString** of the
**PexSymbolicValue** class return expressions representing symbolic
values and the path condition, formatted as
[S-expressions](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/S-expression).

As we know, Pex uses the Z3 SMT solver behind the scenes. If you want to
get the path conditions before being passed to Z3, do the following:

1.  Create an environment variable with name **z3\_logdir** and value
    **c:\\z3\_logdir** (or any other directory you want)
2.  Create an environment variable with name **z3\_loglevel** and value
    **constraintsandmodel** .

Now, Pex will create \*.z3 files in subdirectories in the *z3\_logdir*
you specified in step 1. These files are in Z3 native format and can be
later passed to Z3. For more information about this format, refer to [Z3
online
documentation](http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/um/people/leonardo/z3_doc/group__z3native.html "Z3 native input format").

In future posts we will talk more about the Z3 native format and what we
can do with it.
