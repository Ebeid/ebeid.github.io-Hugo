SWEBOK or Software Engineering Body Of Knowledge is
an all-inclusive term that describes the sum of knowledge within the
profession of software engineering. Since it is usually not possible to
put the full body of knowledge of even an emerging discipline, such as
software engineering, into a single document, there is a need for a
Guide to the Software Engineering Body of Knowledge. This Guide will
seek to identify and describe that subset of the body of knowledge that
is generally accepted.

SWEBOK Guide is developed by the IEEE Computer Society with leaders from
industry and academia. It is ratified by ISO-IEC 24773 standard as the
BOK for software engineering certifications internationally. The CSDA
and CSDP are the first 2 certifications to conform to the ISO-IEC
standard.

Here are the SWEBOK knowledge areas, its sub areas, and it’s references
and suggested books.
