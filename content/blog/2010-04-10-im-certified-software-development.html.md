is my pleasure to share with you my recent achievement. Now I’m **IEEE
Computer Society Certified Software Development Professional** **CSDP**.

The CSDP credential is intended for mid-career software development
professionals that want to confirm their proficiency of standard
software development practices and advance in their careers.

<span class="underline"></span>

**<span class="underline">Certified Software Development Professional
should</span>:**

-   Possesses fundamental knowledge and understanding of computing
    principles and concepts and their application to the definition,
    design, construction, testing of software.
-   Be able to apply design principles with technical and economic
    tradeoffs to modules, subsystems, and systems in accordance with
    standards of practice, specifications, and principles of behavior of
    software as required to perform the functions as stated in the
    software requirements.
-   Has met the IEEE CS CSDP education, experience, and examination
    requirements.

**<span class="underline">How to become an CSDP</span>:**

1.  Application Steps
    1.  Obtain CSDP candidate brochure from IEEE Computer Society
        <http://www.computer.org/certification/>
    2.  Review requirements
    3.  Complete application
    4.  Send completed application to IEEE CS by deadline with fee
    5.  Acknowledgement of payment
    6.  Review of application
    7.  If accepted, authorization to test sent to candidate
2.  Requirements for Certification
    1.  **Education: (need at least one)**
        -   You have a bachelor's degree
        -   You are a CSDA certificate holder
        -   You are an educator at the post-baccalaureate level
        -   You are a full member of the IEEE
    2.  **Experience: (need at least one)**
        -   You have an advanced degree in software engineering and at
            least two years (about 3,500 hrs) of experience in software
            engineering/development
        -   You have at least four years (about 7,000 hrs) experience in
            software engineering/development
3.  Preparation for Examination
    1.  Depends on level of expertise in areas covered by Body of
        Knowledge
    2.  Focus on areas needing the most review
    3.  Study from the suggested reference material
    4.  Can take a refresher course (see CSDP website)
    5.  Unless your background covers most of the Body of Knowledge,
        allow three months of 2-4 hours a week for study
    6.  Last week: assemble test access materials
4.  Examination
    1.  Length: 4 hours
    2.  Closed book, computer based
    3.  At a Prometric training center (in Egypt only
        [AMIDEAST](http://www.amideast.org/offices/egypt/cairo/default.htm)
        Cairo branch)
    4.  Format  
        • 180 multiple-choice questions that are based on concepts and
        experiences that should be familiar to a proficient software
        engineering professional with 7,000 or more hours of experience.
        The topic areas are grouped by question deve lopment into
        domains. The percentage range of questions in each area is as
        follows:
        -   Business Practices and Engineering Economics (3–4%)
        -   Software Requirements (13–15%)
        -   Software Design (22–24%)
        -   Software Construction (10–12%)
        -   Software Testing (15–17%)
        -   Software Maintenance (3–5%)
        -   Software Configuration Management (3–4%)
        -   Software Engineering Management (10–12%)
        -   Software Engineering Process (2–4%)
        -   Software Engineering Tools and Methods (2–4%)
        -   Software Quality (6–8%)
